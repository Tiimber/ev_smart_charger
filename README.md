# EV Smart Charger & Load Balancer for Home Assistant

**EV Smart Charger** is a custom Home Assistant integration designed to optimize electric vehicle charging based on real-time electricity prices (eg. Nordpool), household load balancing (P1 Meter), and user scheduling. It also allows you to charge your car to different percentages based on if the electricity price is very low of high.

This is written to fit my need, which is a very specific combination, but I've tried to cover a more generic use case and I do believe you could create your own switches and sensors with custom templates and automations to make practically any brands work. My specific combination is Nordpool for electricity spot price, a P1ib device hooked into my electric meters' HAN-port of my electric meter, Zaptec Go as charger for my Hyundai Kona, connected through the Hyundai / Kia Connect Custom Integration.

I also have a Local Calendar integration, where I in advance have set my specific, varying, but on a recurring schedule with ten minute events of each morning, which I use for automatically starting climate just before when I leave home. I have made this calendar compatible for knowing the target time of the charging window as well. If people are interested, I could bake in my Climate control code into this integration as well, or perhaps make that available as another custom integration.

**Note!** *Much of the code was written by AI, and just tested and heavily inspected and questioned by me in several iterations. I am a programmer in my work, but Python and Home Assistant specifics aren't my specialities.*

## Features

* **Smart Scheduling:** Automatically plans charging during the cheapest hours between now and your departure time.
* **Load Balancing:** Dynamically calculates the maximum safe current to prevent tripping your main house fuse (based on real-time P1ib meter readings).
* **Cost Estimation:** Calculates the total session cost including Spot Price, Grid Fees, and VAT.
* **Calendar Integration:** Reads your local calendar for events to set custom departure times and target charge levels automatically.
  * In my case, I have varying schedule that repeats every two weeks, one pattern the first week and another the next week.
* **Manual Overrides:** Easily override the next charging session's target percentage or departure time without affecting your standard daily schedule.
* **Maintenance Mode:** Keeps the charger active (if price allows) after reaching the target to support battery balancing or climate control.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

1.  **P1ib/Grid Meter:** Sensors reporting current (Amps) for Phase 1, 2, and 3.
2.  **Electricity Price Sensor (Optional):** A sensor providing electricity prices with `today` and `tomorrow` attributes per quarter of an hour (e.g., via the [Nordpool custom component](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool)). If omitted, the integration will perform Load Balancing only (charging immediately).
3.  **ApexCharts Card (Optional):** Required for the recommended visualization graph. Install via HACS (Frontend > ApexCharts Card).

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1.  Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2.  Go to **Integrations** > **Top Right Menu** > **Custom repositories**.
3.  Add `Tiimber/ev_smart_charger` as an **Integration**.
4.  Click **Download**.
5.  Restart Home Assistant.

### Method 2: Manual

1.  Copy the `ev_smart_charger` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2.  Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

1.  Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**.
2.  Search for **EV Smart Charger** and follow the configuration steps.

## Configuration Parameters

During setup, you will map your existing Home Assistant entities:

* **Car Sensors:** SoC (State of Charge) and Plugged-in status.
* **Car Limit (Optional):** Entity to set the limit on the car itself (e.g. `number.kona_charge_limit`).
* **Grid Sensors:** Current (Amps) for L1, L2, and L3 from your P1ib meter.
* **Charger Current:** Current (Amps) for L1/L2/L3 *of the charger itself*. If provided, the logic becomes `Available = Main Fuse - (Grid Total - Charger Load)`. This prevents oscillation loops.
* **Price Sensor:** Electricity/Nordpool sensor (Optional).
* **Zaptec Controls:**
    * **Switch (Recommended):** The main switch entity for the charger (e.g., `switch.zaptec_charging`).
    * **Limiter:** The entity to set the current limit (Amps).
* **Settings:** Main Fuse Size (A), Charger Efficiency Loss (%), and Currency.
* **Calendar (Optional):** A Local Calendar entity to read for trip planning, or advanced recurring travel.

## How to Use

### 1. Smart Mode (Default)
Simply plug in your car. The integration will:
* Calculate the cheapest hours to reach your **Standard Target SoC** by your **Standard Departure Time**.
* Start/Stop the charger automatically.
* Adjust current limits to protect your house fuses.
* If electricity price is low enough, you can have it automatically charge to a higher percentage. Likewise for a very high price, you can set a lower value.

### 2. Manual Override
If you need to leave earlier or charge more for a specific trip:
* Adjust the **"Next Session"** slider or time.
* The system immediately switches to **Override Mode**, strictly following your new settings.
* **Reset:** When you unplug the car, these overrides automatically reset to your standard defaults.

### 3. Calendar Automation
Create an event in your configured calendar. The integration looks for events within the next 24 hours.
* **Departure Time:** Taken from the event Start Time.
* **Target SoC:** To set a custom target, include a percentage in the event title or description (e.g., **"Trip to Cabin 90%"**).

## Entities Explained

This integration creates several entities to help you control and visualize the charging process.

### Controls (Dashboard)
* **Smart Charging Enabled** (`switch`): Master switch. If OFF, the car charges immediately regardless of price.
* **Standard Target SoC** (`number`): Your default daily charge target (e.g., 80%).
* **Next Session Target SoC** (`number`): **Override.** Changing this slider immediately sets a strict target for the *current* session only.
* **Standard Departure Time** (`time`): Default time you leave every morning (e.g., 07:00).
* **Next Session Departure** (`time`): **Override.** Sets a specific departure time for the next trip. Resets to standard after unplugging.
* **Extra Cost per kWh** (`number`): Set your grid fees/transfer costs here to get accurate price summaries. (If not already included in your Electricity Price sensor).
* **VAT Percentage** (`number`): Set your local VAT (e.g., 25) to be added to the spot price.  (If not already included in your Electricity Price sensor).
* **Clear Manual Override** (`button`): Reverts any manual slider/time changes and returns to "Smart Mode" (calculating targets based on price/calendar).
* **Refresh Charging Plan** (`button`): Forces a recalculation of the schedule immediately.

### Sensors (Visualization)
* **Charging Schedule** (`sensor`): Contains the complex data for the graph (prices, charging windows) and a text summary attribute `charging_summary`.
* **Max Safe Current** (`sensor`): The dynamic amperage limit calculated to protect your main fuse.
* **Charger Logic Status** (`sensor`): Shows current state (Disconnected, Waiting, Charging).
* **Price Logic** (`sensor`): Indicates if current electricity price is considered Cheap/Expensive relative to the day's average.

## Dashboard Configuration

To visualize the plan with a graph (as seen in image above), use the **ApexCharts Card** (available via HACS).
